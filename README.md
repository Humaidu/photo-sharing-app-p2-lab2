# Photo Sharing Web App (Serverless with AWS)

This project is a **serverless photo-sharing web application** built entirely with AWS services. Users can upload images via a simple web interface, which are then stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Upon upload, an AWS Lambda function is automatically triggered to create a **resized thumbnail**, which is stored in a separate S3 bucket. Another Lambda function serves the list of thumbnails via **API Gateway**, which the frontend fetches and displays.

## Technologies Used

* AWS S3
* AWS Lambda (Python)
* AWS API Gateway (REST API)
* IAM (Permissions)
* HTML/CSS (Frontend)
* JavaScript (Fetch API)

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. IAM Permissions

Ensure your Lambda functions have the following permissions:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:GetObject",
    "s3:PutObject",
    "s3:ListBucket"
  ],
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::photo-sharing-app-bucket-050/*",
    "arn:aws:s3:::photo-sharing-thumbnails-050/*"
  ]
}
```

Attach this policy to the execution roles of both Lambda functions.

---

### 2. Create S3 Buckets

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://photo-sharing-app-bucket-050
aws s3 mb s3://photo-sharing-thumbnails-050
```

Enable S3 event notifications on `photo-sharing-app-bucket-050` to trigger the resizing Lambda function on new uploads.

---

### 3. Lambda Functions

#### a. `resizer-lambda`

Triggered when a new object is uploaded to the source bucket. Resizes and uploads to the thumbnail bucket.

#### b. `getThumbnailImages`

Returns all thumbnail image URLs for frontend display.

#### c. `getUploadedUrl`

Generates a pre-signed `PUT` URL to securely upload images directly to S3 from the frontend.

All Lambda function code is written in Python and provided earlier in this repo.

---

### 4.API Gateway Configuration

Create a REST API with these routes:

| Method | Route                          | Lambda               |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| GET    | `/getUploadedUrl?filename=...` | `getUploadedUrl`     |
| GET    | `/getThumbnailImages`          | `getThumbnailImages` |

‚úÖ Make sure CORS is enabled on each route (headers: `*`, methods: `GET, OPTIONS`, etc.)

---

### 5. Frontend Integration

Simple upload & display using vanilla JS:

```html
<input type="file" id="imageInput" />
<button onclick="uploadImage()">Upload</button>
<div id="gallery"></div>
```

```js
async function uploadImage() {
    const file = document.getElementById('imageInput').files[0];
    if (!file) return alert("No file selected");

    const filename = encodeURIComponent(file.name);
    const res = await fetch(`https://YOUR_API_ID.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod/getUploadedUrl?filename=${filename}`);
    const { uploadUrl } = await res.json();

    await fetch(uploadUrl, {
        method: 'PUT',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'image/jpeg' },
        body: file
    });

    setTimeout(displayImages, 3000);
}

async function displayImages() {
    const res = await fetch("https://YOUR_API_ID.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod/getThumbnailImages");
    const images = await res.json();
    document.getElementById('gallery').innerHTML = images.map(url => `<img src="${url}" width="150" />`).join('');
}
```

---

## üíª Frontend
### `/index.html`

Basic HTML+JS page to upload and view images. The JavaScript:

- Calls `/getUploadUrl?filename=xyz.jpg`
- Uploads image using `fetch(PUT, presignedURL)`
- Loads thumbnails from `/getThumbnailImages`

---

## üöÄ Deploying the Frontend to AWS S3

You can deploy the frontend using **S3 Static Website Hosting**.

### Step 1: Enable Website Hosting

```bash
aws s3 website s3://photo-sharing-app-frontend-050/ \
  --index-document index.html \
  --error-document index.html
```
### Step 2: Make Bucket Public

**Create a file named `bucket-policy.json`:**

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::photo-sharing-app-frontend-050/*"
    }
  ]
}

```
**Apply the policy:**

```
aws s3api put-bucket-policy \
  --bucket photo-sharing-app-frontend-050 \
  --policy file://bucket-policy.json

```

**Allow public access:**

```
aws s3api put-public-access-block \
  --bucket photo-sharing-app-frontend-050 \
  --public-access-block-configuration BlockPublicAcls=false,IgnorePublicAcls=false,BlockPublicPolicy=false,RestrictPublicBuckets=false

```

### Step 3: Upload Files

```
aws s3 sync ./frontend/ s3://photo-sharing-app-frontend-050/ --recursive 

```
### Step 4: Access Your Site

**Visit:**

```
http://photo-sharing-app-frontend-050.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Don't use the S3 REST endpoint (.s3.amazonaws.com) directly; it will show Access Denied unless you specify the full index.html.

## User Authentication for Photo Sharing App

This document explains the **user authentication system** used in the [Photo Sharing App](https://d3se36oyslytfb.cloudfront.net) built with a static frontend hosted on **Amazon S3/CloudFront** and backend services integrated with **AWS Cognito**, **Lambda**, and **API Gateway**.

---

### Overview

The authentication mechanism uses **Amazon Cognito User Pools** with the **Hosted UI** flow to manage:

- User sign-up & sign-in
- Token-based authentication (ID token & access token)
- Session persistence via `localStorage`
- Access-controlled navigation (e.g., `upload.html` requires authentication)

---

### Tech Stack

| Component       | Technology                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Auth Provider   | AWS Cognito User Pool (Hosted UI)   |
| Frontend        | HTML/CSS/JavaScript (static hosting)|
| Storage         | AWS S3 (static site + image uploads)|
| Edge Delivery   | AWS CloudFront                     |
| APIs            | AWS API Gateway + Lambda           |

---

### Authentication Flow

1. When user clicks **Login**, they are redirected to the Cognito Hosted UI.
2. After successful login, Cognito redirects the user back to `upload.html` with an authorization code.
3. The frontend exchanges this code for **ID** and **access tokens** via `/oauth2/token`.
4. Tokens are stored in `localStorage` for session persistence.
5. The app decodes the token to:
   - Show/hide Login or Logout buttons
   - Conditionally load private pages like `upload.html`

### Redirect URIs

Your app uses the following redirect after authentication:

```js
const redirectUri = "https://d3se36oyslytfb.cloudfront.net/upload.html";

```
Make sure this URI is added to the Allowed Callback URLs and Sign Out URLs in your Cognito App Client settings.


### Testing Auth Flow

- Click Login
- Authenticate via Cognito UI
- You‚Äôll be redirected to upload.html
- The app will:
  - Display your email
  - Enable logout
  - Load uploaded images (if any)
- Click Logout ‚Üí Returns to index.html


## Notes

- Ensure Cognito App Client has no client secret (public client).
- All redirect URIs must be HTTPS (required by Cognito).
- Only users with valid tokens can access image upload functionality.


---

## DynamoDB Integration

This application integrates **Amazon DynamoDB** to store metadata for each uploaded image. The metadata is captured during the image upload and thumbnail generation workflow.

### Workflow Overview

1. The user uploads an image to an S3 bucket using a **presigned URL**.
2. The **user's email address** (from Cognito) is attached as object metadata (`x-amz-meta-email`) during upload.
3. An S3 **event trigger** invokes the `image_resizer.py` Lambda function.
4. This function:
   - Downloads and resizes the image to generate a thumbnail.
   - Uploads the thumbnail to a separate S3 bucket or prefix.
   - Extracts metadata (e.g., `email`) from the original object.
   - Writes metadata to **DynamoDB**.

---

### DynamoDB Table Structure

The table is created using the AWS Console or Infrastructure as Code with the following attributes:

| Attribute     | Type   | Key            | Description                                  |
|---------------|--------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `image_id`    | String | Partition Key  | The S3 key of the original uploaded image    |
| `thumbnail`   | String | ‚Äî              | S3 key of the generated thumbnail            |
| `email`       | String | ‚Äî              | Uploader‚Äôs email address (from Cognito)      |
| `upload_time` | String | ‚Äî              | ISO 8601 timestamp of the image upload       |

---

### Sample Item

```json
{
  "image_id": "uploads/photo1.jpg",
  "thumbnail": "thumbnails/thumb-photo1.jpg",
  "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
  "upload_time": "2025-06-16T18:25:43Z"
}

```

## Security Notes

* All uploads use time-limited pre-signed URLs
* No public write access to S3
* CORS headers are enabled to support frontend requests

---

## Example Usage

- Visit the frontend.
- Upload an image.
- Lambda resizes it.
- Thumbnails are displayed in the gallery.

---

## Testing Tips

* Use browser dev tools to inspect network requests
* Check S3 for uploaded and resized images
* Monitor CloudWatch logs for Lambda errors

---

## Future Improvements

* Add delete image feature
* UI/UX enhancements using frameworks like React or Vue
